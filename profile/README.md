Lockerless is Trusted single-use box for encrypted messages. 
the motto is: 
+ "Disposable Safe"
+ "Single-Use Vault"
+ "Your secret box"


Considering these impressions, **"Single-Use Vault"** may be the best choice if the emphasis is on strong security and the idea of each message being as secure as valuables in a bank vault. However, if the company wants to stress the temporary and disposable nature of the service more, **"Disposable Safe"** might be a better fit. **"One-Time Safe"** strikes a balance between the two and might be chosen if a compromise between security and disposability is desired. 

## How it works?
LockerLess is a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform designed for secure, encrypted communications with exchange files.
It provides users with a way to send messages and attachments that are protected with end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the intended recipients can access and read them. 

Using LockerLess would typically involve either a web-based interface or a mobile app where users can create a message, 
attach any files if needed, and then encrypt the entire package with a simple "copy-paste/share" mechanism. Here’s how it would work across devices and get back the secure link (url).
Recipients of the secure link can then access the LockerLess securebox, where they will be able to decrypt the message and download any attachments using a decryption key or a password.

This process ensures that sensitive information remains confidential from the moment it's sent to when it's received.

1. **On a Computer:**
   - Access the LockerLess web platform.
   - Write your message and attach files.
   - Click on "Encrypt" to secure the content.
   - The service generates a secure link.
   - Copy the link and paste it into an email, chat, or any other form of communication.

2. **On a Mobile Device:**
   - Open the LockerLess app.
   - Enter your message and attach files directly from your device's storage.
   - Tap "Encrypt" and wait for the service to create a secure, shareable link.
   - Share the link via SMS, messaging apps, or email using the built-in share options in your device.
