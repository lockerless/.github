## [lockerless.com - your secret box](https://www.lockerless.com/)

Lockerless is Trusted single-use box for encrypted messages. 
the motto is: 
+ "Disposable Safe"
+ "Single-Use Vault"
+ "Your secret box"


Considering these impressions, **"Single-Use Vault"** may be the best choice if the emphasis is on strong security and the idea of each message being as secure as valuables in a bank vault. However, if the company wants to stress the temporary and disposable nature of the service more, **"Disposable Safe"** might be a better fit. **"One-Time Safe"** strikes a balance between the two and might be chosen if a compromise between security and disposability is desired.
